To fix this issue, include the state variables used inside the `useCallback` function within the dependency array. This ensures that the function is recreated whenever those dependencies change.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Use functional update
  }, [count]); // Include count in dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

By adding `count` to the dependency array, the `increment` function is now correctly updated whenever the `count` state changes.  The use of `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is also best practice to ensure you always have the latest state value, preventing potential race conditions.

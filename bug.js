This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that accesses state variables from outside its scope. Because the returned function from `useCallback` is memoized, it does not re-render when the state variables change, even though the function depends on them. This leads to the function using stale closure values.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // count is stale here
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
